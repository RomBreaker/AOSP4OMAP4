Local manifest addon for AOSP ICS on Motorola OMAP4 devices
	-specifically solana, targa and spyder

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

Make a build directory:

	mkdir Andoid (or whatever name you choose)
	cd Android (or the name  you chose)

To initialize your local repository using the AOSP manifest, use a command like this:

    repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b android-4.0.1_r1.2
    
    Download: https://github.com/ICSTH3ORY/AOSP4OMAP4/local_manifest.xml
		and place it in ~/Android/.repo/local_manifest.xml (or ~/'name you chose'/.repo)

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
